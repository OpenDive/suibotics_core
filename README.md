# Suibotics Core

A comprehensive suite of autonomous robotics and drone delivery smart contracts built on the Sui blockchain.

## Projects Overview

### ü§ñ [Crossy Robot](./crossy_robot/)
A blockchain-based autonomous robot navigation and coordination system. Features pathfinding algorithms, obstacle avoidance, and multi-robot coordination protocols for safe and efficient robotic operations.

**Key Features:**
- Autonomous navigation and pathfinding
- Real-time obstacle detection and avoidance
- Multi-robot coordination and collision prevention
- Blockchain-verified movement and state tracking

### üÜî [Suibotics DID](./suibotics_did/)
Decentralized Identity (DID) system for autonomous robots and drones. Provides secure identity management, authentication, and authorization for robotic systems operating on the blockchain.

**Key Features:**
- Decentralized identity management for robots/drones
- Cryptographic authentication and authorization
- Identity verification and reputation tracking
- Secure credential management

### üöÅ [Swarm Logistics](./swarm_logistics/)
Advanced autonomous drone delivery and logistics coordination system. A comprehensive smart contract suite for managing drone fleets, delivery operations, and swarm coordination.

**Key Features:**
- Autonomous drone fleet management
- Order processing and delivery coordination
- Economic engine with dynamic pricing
- DAO governance for decentralized operations
- Maintenance scheduling and resource management
- Flight control and navigation systems
- Swarm coordination and airspace management

## Getting Started

Each project contains its own detailed README with setup instructions, deployment guides, and usage examples. Navigate to the respective directories for more information:

- [Crossy Robot Documentation](./crossy_robot/README.md)
- [Suibotics DID Documentation](./suibotics_did/README.md)
- [Swarm Logistics Documentation](./swarm_logistics/README.md)

## Architecture

The Suibotics Core ecosystem is designed with modularity and interoperability in mind:

- **Crossy Robot** provides the foundational navigation and coordination primitives
- **Suibotics DID** handles identity and security across all robotic systems
- **Swarm Logistics** implements complex delivery operations and fleet management

Together, these projects form a complete autonomous robotics platform capable of handling everything from individual robot navigation to large-scale drone delivery operations.
