# Crossy Robot Deployment Guide

This guide covers deploying the Crossy Robot game contracts to Sui testnet. The package includes two distinct robot control contracts:

- **`crossy_robot`** - Pay-to-play (0.05 SUI per game, robot earns payment)
- **`crowd_robot`** - Free crowd-controlled (2-minute games, anyone can control)

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

1. **Sui CLI installed**
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install sui
   
   # Or download from: https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install
   ```

2. **Active Sui wallet with testnet tokens**
   ```bash
   # Create new wallet
   sui client new-address ed25519
   
   # Or import existing wallet
   sui client import <private-key>
   
   # Get testnet tokens
   sui client faucet
   # Or visit: https://faucet.sui.io/
   ```

3. **jq for JSON parsing (recommended)**
   ```bash
   brew install jq  # macOS
   ```

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Comprehensive Deployment (Recommended)

Use this for production-ready deployment with full validation:

```bash
./deploy_testnet.sh
```

**Features:**
- âœ… Pre-deployment environment checks
- âœ… Automatic testnet setup
- âœ… Gas balance validation and faucet requests
- âœ… Build and test execution
- âœ… Detailed logging and error handling
- âœ… Post-deployment verification
- âœ… Explorer links and integration examples

### Option 2: Quick Deployment

Use this for rapid testing and development:

```bash
./deploy_simple.sh
```

**Features:**
- Fast deployment with minimal checks
- Essential steps only
- Package ID extraction
- Explorer links

### Option 3: Manual Deployment

For custom deployment workflows:

```bash
# Switch to testnet
sui client switch --env testnet

# Build and test
sui move build
sui move test

# Deploy
sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000
```

## Deployment Results

After successful deployment, you'll receive:

### Contract Functions

#### Original Contract (`crossy_robot`)
- `create_game(payment, clock, ctx)` - Create new game with 0.05 SUI payment
- `connect_robot(game, clock, ctx)` - Robot connects to game and receives payment
- `move_robot(game, direction, clock, ctx)` - Issue movement command (0-7 directions)

#### Crowd-Controlled Contract (`crowd_robot`)
- `create_game(clock, ctx)` - Create new free game (2-minute duration)
- `move_robot(game, direction, clock, ctx)` - Anyone can submit movement commands
- `end_game(game, clock, ctx)` - Manually end expired games

### Events

#### Original Contract Events
- `GameCreated` - New game available for robots
- `RobotConnected` - Robot accepted the game
- `RobotMoved` - Movement command issued

#### Crowd-Controlled Contract Events
- `GameCreated` - New free game available
- `RobotMoved` - Movement command from any player
- `GameEnded` - Game completed with statistics

## ðŸ”§ Integration Examples

### Frontend (TypeScript)
```typescript
const PACKAGE_ID = '0xcf21b35cca41042a29b030ec7f8d7c54d80235b9fcac438cab72fd89616c82ab';

// Original Contract (Pay-to-play)
const createPaidGame = async () => {
  const payment = /* 0.05 SUI coin */;
  const tx = new TransactionBlock();
  tx.moveCall({
    target: `${PACKAGE_ID}::crossy_robot::create_game`,
    arguments: [payment, clock],
  });
  return await signAndExecute(tx);
};

// Crowd-Controlled Contract (Free)
const createFreeGame = async () => {
  const tx = new TransactionBlock();
  tx.moveCall({
    target: `${PACKAGE_ID}::crowd_robot::create_game`,
    arguments: [clock],
  });
  return await signAndExecute(tx);
};

// Move robot (works for both contracts)
const moveRobot = async (gameId: string, direction: number, contractType: 'crossy_robot' | 'crowd_robot') => {
  const tx = new TransactionBlock();
  tx.moveCall({
    target: `${PACKAGE_ID}::${contractType}::move_robot`,
    arguments: [gameId, direction, clock],
  });
  return await signAndExecute(tx);
};
```

### Robot Listener (Python)
```python
import asyncio
from sui_sdk import SuiClient

PACKAGE_ID = "0xcf21b35cca41042a29b030ec7f8d7c54d80235b9fcac438cab72fd89616c82ab"

# Listen for game events (both contract types)
async def listen_for_games():
    # Subscribe to GameCreated events from both contracts
    # crossy_robot events: include payment info
    # crowd_robot events: include game duration/end_time
    
    # For crossy_robot: Call connect_robot() to accept game and earn payment
    # For crowd_robot: Just start monitoring (no connection needed)
    pass

# Listen for movement events  
async def listen_for_movements():
    # Subscribe to RobotMoved events from both contracts
    # Parse direction from event (0-7 for both)
    # Execute physical movement
    
    # crowd_robot games automatically end after 2 minutes
    # crossy_robot games continue indefinitely
    pass

# Listen for game end events (crowd_robot only)
async def listen_for_game_ends():
    # Subscribe to GameEnded events from crowd_robot
    # Parse game statistics (duration, moves, players)
    # Reset robot state for next game
    pass
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Sui CLI not found"
```bash
# Install Sui CLI
brew install sui
# Or visit: https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install
```

#### 2. "Insufficient gas balance"
```bash
# Request testnet tokens
sui client faucet
# Or visit: https://faucet.sui.io/
```

#### 3. "Not on testnet"
```bash
# Switch to testnet
sui client switch --env testnet

# Verify environment
sui client envs
```

#### 4. "Build failed"
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
rm -rf build/
sui move build
```

#### 5. "Tests failed"
```bash
# Run tests with verbose output
sui move test --verbose
```

### Script Permissions
If you get permission errors:
```bash
chmod +x deploy_testnet.sh deploy_simple.sh
```

### JSON Parsing Issues
If jq is not available:
```bash
# Install jq
brew install jq  # macOS
apt-get install jq  # Ubuntu/Debian
```

## Generated Files

After deployment, these files are created:

- `deployment_info.json` - Package ID and deployment details
- `deployment_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log` - Detailed deployment logs (comprehensive script only)
- `build/` - Compiled Move bytecode

## Redeployment

To redeploy (creates new package):
```bash
# Clean previous build
rm -rf build/ deployment_info.json

# Run deployment script again
./deploy_testnet.sh
```
