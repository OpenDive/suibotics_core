# Suibotics DID

A production-ready decentralized identity and credential management system built on the Sui blockchain, designed specifically for IoT devices and robotics applications with full W3C DID Core specification compliance.

## Overview

Suibotics DID provides a comprehensive framework for managing digital identities and verifiable credentials in IoT ecosystems. The system enables secure device authentication, credential issuance, and trust establishment between IoT devices, certificate authorities, and service providers. Built with type safety, comprehensive validation, production-grade error handling, and **advanced batch operations** for efficient fleet management.

## Features

### Decentralized Identity (DID) Management
- **DID Registration**: Create unique decentralized identifiers for IoT devices
- **Key Management**: Add, revoke, and manage cryptographic keys with type-safe dynamic field handling
- **Service Endpoints**: Complete service lifecycle management (add, update, remove)
- **Controller Verification**: Ensure only authorized entities can modify DID documents
- **W3C DID Document Resolution**: Full compliance with W3C DID Core specification
- **Type-Safe Architecture**: Prevents key/service ID collisions with wrapper structs

### Batch Operations ✨ **NEW**
- **Bulk DID Registration**: Register up to 50 DIDs in a single transaction for device fleet onboarding
- **Batch Key Management**: Add or revoke keys across multiple DIDs simultaneously
- **Batch Service Operations**: Bulk add, update, or remove service endpoints across device fleets
- **Batch Credential Operations**: Issue or revoke credentials in bulk for fleet-wide operations
- **Partial Success Handling**: Individual operation failures don't affect successful operations
- **Gas Optimization**: Significant cost savings for fleet management operations
- **Detailed Result Tracking**: Complete success/failure reporting for each operation

### Verifiable Credentials
- **Credential Issuance**: Issue tamper-proof credentials to devices
- **Schema Validation**: Support for structured credential schemas
- **Revocation Management**: Revoke credentials when necessary
- **Timestamp Tracking**: Track credential issuance and revocation times
- **Credential Discovery**: Multi-dimensional indexing for efficient credential lookup

### Security Features
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all inputs
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control for DID and credential operations
- **Event Logging**: Immutable event logs for all operations with comprehensive change tracking
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with descriptive error codes
- **Type Safety**: Dynamic field type confusion prevention with KeyFieldKey/ServiceFieldKey wrappers

### W3C Standards Compliance
- **DID Documents**: Full W3C DID Core specification compliance
- **Verification Methods**: Support for multiple key types and purposes
- **Service Endpoints**: Standards-compliant service registration and management
- **Resolution**: Complete DID document resolution from on-chain data

## Architecture

The system consists of three focused modules with clean separation of concerns:

1. **identity_types** (`sources/identity_types.move`): Core data structures, validation logic, and W3C DID document building
2. **did_registry** (`sources/did_registry.move`): DID registration, key management, service lifecycle, and batch operations
3. **credential_registry** (`sources/credential_registry.move`): Credential issuance, revocation, discovery, and batch operations

### Key Architectural Improvements
- **Type-Safe Dynamic Fields**: Separate namespaces for keys and services prevent ID collisions
- **DID Document Resolution**: On-chain data structures that build W3C-compliant DID documents
- **Service Lifecycle Management**: Complete add → update → remove workflow with audit trails
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient bulk operations with partial success handling
- **Production-Ready Patterns**: Comprehensive error handling, validation, and event emission

## Dual Registry System

Suibotics DID uses **two separate registry systems** that serve distinct but complementary purposes:

### DID Registry (`did_registry`)
**Purpose**: Manages **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)** and their associated identity data

**What it stores:**
- **DID documents** with verification methods (public keys)
- **Service endpoints** (like MQTT brokers, API endpoints)
- **Name-to-address mappings** for human-readable DID names
- **Key management** (add, revoke keys)

**Key functions:**
```move
// Register a new DID identity
did_registry::register_did(registry, name, pubkey, purpose, ctx)

// Add keys for different purposes (authentication, assertion, etc.)
did_registry::add_key(did, key_id, pubkey, purpose, ctx)

// Manage service endpoints
did_registry::add_service(did, service_id, service_type, endpoint, ctx)
did_registry::update_service(did, service_id, new_type, new_endpoint, ctx)
did_registry::remove_service(did, service_id, ctx)

// Build W3C-compliant DID documents
did_registry::build_did_document(did, did_string, key_ids, service_ids)

// ✨ NEW: Batch operations for fleet management
did_registry::register_dids_batch(registry, names, pubkeys, purposes, ctx)
did_registry::add_keys_batch(dids, key_ids, pubkeys, purposes, ctx)
did_registry::revoke_keys_batch(dids, key_ids, ctx)
did_registry::add_services_batch(dids, service_ids, types, endpoints, ctx)
did_registry::update_services_batch(dids, service_ids, new_types, new_endpoints, ctx)
```

### Credential Registry (`credential_registry`)
**Purpose**: Manages **Verifiable Credentials** and enables credential discovery

**What it stores:**
- **Credential metadata** (issuer, subject, schema, timestamps)
- **Discovery indices** (by subject, issuer, schema, time ranges)
- **Revocation status** tracking
- **Registry statistics** (total credentials, active, revoked)

**Key functions:**
```move
// Issue credentials to subjects
credential_registry::issue_credential(registry, subject, schema, data_hash, ctx)

// Revoke credentials
credential_registry::revoke_credential(registry, credential, ctx)

// Discovery functions
credential_registry::get_credentials_by_subject(registry, subject)
credential_registry::get_credentials_by_issuer(registry, issuer)
credential_registry::get_credentials_by_schema(registry, schema)
credential_registry::get_active_credentials_by_subject(registry, subject)

// ✨ NEW: Batch operations for fleet management
credential_registry::issue_credentials_batch(registry, subjects, issuers, schemas, hashes, ctx)
credential_registry::revoke_credentials_batch(credentials, ctx)
```

### Batch Operations Architecture

Both registries support **efficient batch processing** with the following design principles:

#### **Batch Result Tracking**
```move
public struct BatchResult has copy, drop {
    index: u64,      // Operation index in the batch
    success: bool,   // Whether this operation succeeded
    error_code: u64, // Error code if operation failed
}
```

#### **Partial Success Handling**
- ✅ **Individual failures don't affect successful operations**
- ✅ **Detailed tracking of which operations succeeded/failed**
- ✅ **Granular error codes for debugging**
- ✅ **Size limits (max 50 operations) prevent gas issues**

#### **Utility Functions**
```move
// Count successful operations
count_batch_successes(results: &vector<BatchResult>): u64

// Get indices of failed operations
get_batch_failures(results: &vector<BatchResult>): vector<u64>

// Check if entire batch succeeded
is_batch_fully_successful(results: &vector<BatchResult>): bool
```

### Architectural Comparison

| Aspect | DID Registry | Credential Registry |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Data Focus** | Identity & verification methods | Attestations & claims |
| **Ownership** | DIDs owned by controllers | Credentials owned by subjects |
| **Discovery** | Name-based lookup | Multi-dimensional indexing |
| **Lifecycle** | Create → Update → (Keys/Services) | Issue → Verify → Revoke |
| **Batch Ops** | Device fleet onboarding | Bulk credential management |
| **Standards** | W3C DID Core specification | W3C VC Data Model |

### Why Separate Registries?

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Identity management vs. credential management are distinct functions
2. **Scalability**: Each registry can be optimized for its specific access patterns
3. **Security**: Different access controls and validation rules
4. **Standards Compliance**: Each follows different W3C specifications

### How They Work Together

```move
// 1. Alice registers her DID (identity)
did_registry::register_did(&mut did_registry, b"alice_ca", pubkey, b"authentication", ctx);

// 2. Alice issues a credential to Bob (using her DID as issuer)
credential_registry::issue_credential(&mut cred_registry, BOB, b"DeviceCert", hash, ctx);

// 3. Bob can discover all credentials issued to him
let bobs_creds = credential_registry::get_credentials_by_subject(&cred_registry, BOB);

// 4. Anyone can resolve Alice's DID to verify her keys
let alice_did_doc = did_registry::build_did_document(&alice_did, did_string, key_ids, service_ids);

// ✨ 5. NEW: Bulk operations for fleet management
// Register 25 IoT devices in one transaction
let results = did_registry::register_dids_batch(&mut registry, device_names, pubkeys, purposes, ctx);

// Issue firmware attestations to the fleet
let cred_results = credential_registry::issue_credentials_batch(
    &mut cred_registry, devices, issuers, schemas, hashes, ctx
);
```

This separation makes the system more modular, secure, and allows each registry to be optimized for its specific use case, while batch operations enable efficient fleet management.

// Add an MQTT service endpoint
did_registry::add_service(
    &mut did_info,
    b"mqtt_broker",          // Service ID
    b"MQTTBroker",          // Service type
    b"mqtt://device.local:1883", // Endpoint URL
    ctx
);

// Update the service endpoint
did_registry::update_service(
    &mut did_info,
    b"mqtt_broker",          // Service ID
    b"MQTTBroker",          // New service type
    b"mqtt://device.local:8883", // New endpoint URL
    ctx
);

// Remove the service
did_registry::remove_service(
    &mut did_info,
    b"mqtt_broker",          // Service ID to remove
    ctx
);
```

### W3C DID Document Resolution

```move
// Build a complete W3C-compliant DID document
let did_document = did_registry::build_did_document(
    &did_info,
    verification_methods,    // Custom verification methods
    services,               // Custom services
);

// Or build with basic configuration
let basic_document = did_registry::build_basic_did_document(&did_info);
```

### Issuing Credentials

```move
// Issue a firmware attestation credential
credential_registry::issue_credential(
    device_address,          // Credential subject
    b"FirmwareAttestation",  // Credential schema
    firmware_hash,           // Data hash
    ctx
);
```

### ✨ NEW: Batch Operations

#### Batch DID Registration (Fleet Onboarding)
```move
// Register 25 IoT devices in a single transaction
let device_names = vector[b"sensor_001", b"sensor_002", /*...*/];
let device_pubkeys = vector[pubkey1, pubkey2, /*...*/];
let purposes = vector[b"auth", b"auth", /*...*/];

let results = did_registry::register_dids_batch(
    &mut registry,
    device_names,
    device_pubkeys, 
    purposes,
    ctx
);

// Check results
let success_count = did_registry::count_batch_successes(&results);
let failures = did_registry::get_batch_failures(&results);
assert!(success_count == 25, 1); // All devices registered successfully
```

#### Batch Credential Issuance (Fleet Management)
```move
// Issue firmware attestation credentials to device fleet
let subjects = vector[device1_addr, device2_addr, device3_addr];
let issuers = vector[ca_addr, ca_addr, ca_addr];
let schemas = vector[b"FirmwareAttest", b"FirmwareAttest", b"FirmwareAttest"];
let hashes = vector[fw_hash1, fw_hash2, fw_hash3];

let results = credential_registry::issue_credentials_batch(
    &mut cred_registry,
    subjects,
    issuers,
    schemas,
    hashes,
    ctx
);

// Verify all credentials issued successfully
assert!(credential_registry::is_batch_fully_successful(&results), 1);
```

#### Batch Key Management (Security Operations)
```move
// Revoke compromised keys across multiple devices
let compromised_key_ids = vector[b"backup_key", b"backup_key", b"backup_key"];

let results = did_registry::revoke_keys_batch(
    &mut device_dids,
    compromised_key_ids,
    ctx
);

// Track which devices had keys successfully revoked
let revoked_count = did_registry::count_batch_successes(&results);
```

#### Handling Partial Success
```move
// Batch operation with mixed results
let results = did_registry::register_dids_batch(
    &mut registry,
    names_with_duplicate,  // One name already exists
    pubkeys,
    purposes,
    ctx
);

// Check which operations failed
if (!did_registry::is_batch_fully_successful(&results)) {
    let failures = did_registry::get_batch_failures(&results);
    // failures = [2] - indicates index 2 failed (duplicate name)
    
    let success_count = did_registry::count_batch_successes(&results);
    // success_count = 2 out of 3 operations succeeded
}
```

## Error Codes

The system uses standardized error codes for consistent error handling:

- `1`: Invalid controller (unauthorized access)
- `2`: Key not found
- `3`: Key already exists
- `4`: Name already exists
- `5`: Invalid public key
- `6`: Invalid data hash
- `7`: Empty field
- `8`: Field too long
- `9`: Invalid address
- `10`: Batch too large (max 50 operations) ✨ **NEW**

## Events

The system emits comprehensive events for all major operations with detailed change tracking:

### DID Events
- `DIDRegistered`: When a new DID is registered
- `KeyAdded`: When a key is added to a DID
- `KeyRevoked`: When a key is revoked
- `ServiceAdded`: When a service endpoint is added
- `ServiceUpdated`: When a service endpoint is updated (with old/new values)
- `ServiceRemoved`: When a service endpoint is removed

### Credential Events
- `CredentialIssued`: When a credential is issued
- `CredentialRevoked`: When a credential is revoked

**Note**: Batch operations emit individual events for each successful operation, providing complete audit trails.
